      <p>This Privacy Policy regulates access to and use of the services (hereinafter referred to as the "Service") that B-FY makes available to the User in its various forms.</p>

      <p>Legitimate interest, where applicable.</p>
      
      <p>The prospective offer of products and services to customers is based on the satisfaction of a legitimate business interest in being able to offer our customers the opportunity to purchase other products or services and thus gain their loyalty.

      <p>The legal basis for sending commercial communications to non-customer users is the consent that has been requested, which may be revoked at any time. The withdrawal of such consent shall in no case affect the execution of the contract, but the processing of data for this purpose carried out previously shall not lose its lawfulness due to the fact that the consent has been revoked.</p>
      
      <p>In those cases in which it is planned to process personal data for a purpose other than that to which the User initially consented, the User will be provided with sufficient information on the new purpose to obtain his or her consent once again.</p>
