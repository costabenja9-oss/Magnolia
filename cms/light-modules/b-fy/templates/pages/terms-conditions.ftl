      <h3>d. Hyperlinks</h3>
      
      <p>The B-FY Service may contain hyperlinks that allow the User to access third-party platforms or websites. B-FY assumes no responsibility for the content, information or services that may appear on such platforms, which are offered exclusively for information purposes by B-FY, and in no case imply any relationship, acceptance or endorsement between B-FY and the persons or entities holding such content or owners of the sites where they are located.</p>
      
      <p>In these cases, B-FY shall not be responsible for establishing the General and Specific Terms and Conditions to be considered in the use, provision or contracting of these services by third parties and, therefore, cannot be held responsible for them. Some of the links in the Service may be "affiliate links", i.e. links with a special tracking code. Therefore, if such a link is clicked on and a product is purchased, B-FY will receive a commission. The price of the product will always be the same regardless of whether an affiliate link is used or not. In any case, B-FY only recommends products or services that it considers to be of value to its users.</p>
      
      <p>B-FY has neither the power nor the human or technical means to know, control or approve all the information, content, products or services provided by other websites to which links may be established from the Platform. Consequently, B-FY cannot assume any type of responsibility for any aspect relating to the websites to which a link may be established from the Platform, specifically, but not limited to, their operation, access, data, information, files, quality and reliability of their products and services, their own links and/or any of their contents, in general.</p>
      
      <p>However, in the event that B-FY becomes aware that the activity or information to which the links refer is unlawful, constitutes a crime or could damage the property or rights of a third party, it will act with the necessary diligence to remove or disable the corresponding link as soon as possible.</p>
      
      <h2>12. INDEMNITY</h2>
      
      <p>Users shall hold harmless and indemnify and hold B-FY harmless from all damages, liability and expenses that may arise as a result of third party claims against B-FY, and/or its officers and/or representative and/or employee from any charges, claims or demands, including but not limited to legal expenses incurred, resulting from any misuse of the Service that B-FY provides or in violation of these Terms and Conditions.</p>
      
      <p>B-FY will promptly notify them of any claim, action, or process through the data they themselves have provided at the time of registration for the B-FY Service. By accepting these Terms and Conditions, Users acknowledge and accept that B-FY has no direct or indirect liability in relation to the Service contracted between the User and third parties.</p>
      
      <h2>13. DURATION, TERMINATION, WARRANTY TERMINATION, MODIFICATIONS AND GUARANTEE</h2>

      <p>If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the remaining terms and obligations remain in full force and effect and enforceable.</p>
      
      <p>B-FY may delete, modify, or replace the contents of this document at any time, by publishing or sending a notification through the B-FY Service integrated in third parties or by e-mail, without the User being able to claim any compensation whatsoever.</p>
      
      <p>B-FY may at its sole discretion, at any time and for any reason, suspend or terminate these Terms and Conditions with the User.</p>
      
      <p>Likewise, B-FY might suspend access to and use of the Service in the event that the User infringes, violates or breaches these Terms and Conditions. Suspension and/or termination of the B-FY Service shall in no way limit the legal obligations and rights to withhold data or information in the event of a request by a competent authority to that effect.</p>
      
      <p>The B-FY Service is provided "AS IS", "AS AVAILABLE" and with all faults and defects, without warranty of any kind.

      <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of implied warranties or limitations on consumer's statutory rights, in which case some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to you.</p>
